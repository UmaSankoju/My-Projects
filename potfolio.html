      <h3>Acadamic Project</h3>     
      
        <p>
           My project is about studying the solar power unit in our college. We measured how much electricity it produced and how much the college used. We found it was giving less power than expected because of dust and other factors. We suggested cleaning the panels regularly and reducing night-time power use.
           We took readings from the solar inverter and electric meter every day. We noted power produced, consumed, exported, and imported. We also checked temperature. Then we analyzed the data to see how to improve efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          We Use Mainly Excel for storing and calculating the data.
